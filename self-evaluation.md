# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

- The each method allows you to iterate over an array of any size and perform an action on this. The first thing that comes to mind for me is if I had a mailing list and I wanted to automate an email blast to my subscribers I could iterate over my mailing list array and perform the action of sending an email to each person without having to manually do this task.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
- The second challenge gave me a tough time because I was ending my each block *before* printing the answer. I think repetition will be the best way for me to move past this. 

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

I was pretty familiar with string interpolation, so that worked well for me. Also, when I got hung up I dove into ruby-docs, and even though I overlooked it a time or two, after a little while I realized the order I was working in was the flaw. Thanks Ruby-Docs!
